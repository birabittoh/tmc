A decompilation of The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap (GBA, 2004) — and a work-in-progress native PC port built on top of it.

The decompilation reconstructs the original C source from the GBA ROM using static and dynamic analysis.
The PC port compiles that source for x86-64 Linux and Windows, replacing GBA hardware with SDL3, a software PPU renderer, and the agbplay audio engine.

## Supported ROMs

A copy of the original game is required to build either the ROM or the PC port.

| Version  | Filename         | SHA1                                       |
|----------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| USA      | `baserom.gba`    | `b4bd50e4131b027c334547b4524e2dbbd4227130` |
| EU       | `baserom_eu.gba` | `cff199b36ff173fb6faf152653d1bccf87c26fb7` |
| JP       | `baserom_jp.gba` | `6c5404a1effb17f481f352181d0f1c61a2765c5d` |
| USA Demo | `baserom_demo_usa.gba` | `63fcad218f9047b6a9edbb68c98bd0dec322d7a1` |
| JP Demo  | `baserom_demo_jp.gba`  | `9cdb56fa79bba13158b81925c1f3641251326412` |

The PC port currently supports **USA** and **EU**.

## PC Port — Quick Start

Place your ROM in the repository root, then run:

```sh
python3 build.py
```

The script will:
- Check and prompt to install missing dependencies (xmake, SDL3, libpng, fmt, nlohmann-json)
- Initialize git submodules automatically
- Scan for ROM files and verify their checksums
- Let you choose USA, EU, or both
- Extract and convert assets from your ROM
- Compile the native binary for your platform
- Place everything under `dist/<VERSION>/`

Run the result:

```sh
cd dist/USA
./tmc_pc
```

Saves are written to `tmc.sav` in the working directory.

### Dependencies

**Linux (Arch / CachyOS):**
```sh
sudo pacman -S xmake sdl3 libpng fmt nlohmann-json git
```

**Linux (Ubuntu / Debian):**
```sh
sudo apt install xmake libsdl3-dev libpng-dev libfmt-dev nlohmann-json3-dev git
```

**Windows:** Install [xmake](https://xmake.io) and [git](https://git-scm.com). SDL3 and other libraries are downloaded automatically by xmake.

### Nix

A `flake.nix` is provided with all dependencies. Run the port directly with:

```sh
nix run
```

Or enter a development shell:

```sh
nix develop
```

## ROM Build (GBA)

To rebuild the original GBA ROM you also need the `arm-none-eabi` toolchain and [agbcc](https://github.com/pret/agbcc). See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for full instructions.

```sh
xmake rom
```
